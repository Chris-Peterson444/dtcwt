Showing 3D Directional Sensitivity
----------------------------------

The
:download:`3d_dtcwt_directionality.py<../examples/3d_dtcwt_directionality.py>`
script in the examples directory shows how one may demonstrate the directional
sensitivity of the 3D DT-CWT complex subband coefficients. It computes
empirically the maximally sensitive directions for each subband and plots them
in an interactive figure using matplotlib. A screenshot is reproduced below:
